### âœ… Task: Interactive Task Loop with User Feedback

1. **Check if `cursor25xinput.cjs` exists** in the root directory.

   * If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:

     ```js
   // cursor25xinput.cjs - CURSOR25X Interactive Input Handler
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

rl.question('ðŸš€ CURSOR25X prompt: ', (answer) => {
    console.log(answer);
    rl.close();
});

     ```

2. **Main Workflow**:

   * Perform your assigned tasks.

   * Run:

     ```bash
     node cursor25xinput.cjs
     ```
   * The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself.

   * Read the user's input.

   * Based on the input, perform the next set of tasks.

   * Repeat the process.

3. **Exit Condition**:

   * If the user enters `"cursor25x finish"` when prompted, exit the loop and terminate the process.
